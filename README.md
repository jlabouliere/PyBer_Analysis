# PyBer_Analysis
## Project Overview
Utilizing two data sets of city data and fare data, two new analyses were requested.  Initially, fare data was to be
be parceled in a concise data frame basis City Type to show Total Rides, Drivers and Fares with corresponding Average Fares for Rides by City Type and Drivers by City Type.  The secondary analysis utilized Rides by Date to summarize weekly Fares by City Type with an accompanying visual.
## Results
### Summary Data
The data shows that the largest number of rides came from Urban and Suburban City Types with 2,250 rides out of the total 2,375 rides.  Roughly 95% of Total Rides were not from Rural City Types.  Urban and Suburban City Types employed 97% of the drivers and brought in 93% of the Total Fares indicating a disparity in the productivity of the Urban and Suburban versus Rural drivers.

## Recommendations
- Reallocate some Urban Drivers to Rural Areas to eliminate idle drivers in Urban areas and alleviate supply constraints in Rural areas
- Moderately increase the fare price in Urban areas to shorten the spread between Urban and Rural Fares for both Average Fare and per Driver earnings
- Temporarily shift the workforce in Urban and Suburban Cities to Rural Cities during the underutilized times based on weekly demands where Rural Cities show more consistency
